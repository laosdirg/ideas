## What the process is
[What the process is]: #what-the-process-is

Copied from the rust RFC repo :heart:

  - Fork the repo [ideas repository]
  - Copy `0000-template.md` to `text/0000-my-project.md` (where "my-project" is
    descriptive). Don't assign an RFC number yet; This is going to be the PR
    number and we'll rename the file accordingly if the RFC is accepted.
  - Fill in the RFC. Put care into the details: RFCs that do not present
    convincing motivation, demonstrate lack of understanding of the design's
    impact, or are disingenuous about the drawbacks or alternatives tend to
    be poorly-received.
  - Submit a pull request. As a pull request the RFC will receive design
    feedback from the larger community, and the author should be prepared to
    revise it in response.
  - Now that your RFC has an open pull request, use the issue number of the PR
    to update your `0000-` prefix to that number.
  - Build consensus and integrate feedback. RFCs that have broad support are
    much more likely to make progress than those that don't receive any
    comments. Feel free to reach out to the RFC assignee in particular to get
    help identifying stakeholders and obstacles.
